Tests are given in the \href{files.html}{\tt files list} section. They are provided in the /tests/ folder within the distributed software.

In this page we intend to make a summary of all of the architectures in where the M\-T\-K has been tested. The M\-T\-K is intended to be as portable as possible throughout architectures. The following architectures have provided flawless installations of the A\-P\-I and correct execution of the examples\-:


\begin{DoxyPre}
1. Linux 3.2.0-23-generic-pae \#36-Ubuntu SMP i386 GNU/Linux
   Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1.73GHz 2048 KB of cache and stepping of 8
   gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)
\end{DoxyPre}


Further architectures will be tested!
